# password_manager
A sqlite3, python password manager. Add passwords, delete passwords, update passwords and get passwords. All passwords encrypted before input into database.

<hr>
Before running the main code file: manager.py. You will need to run the generate_key_file.py to generate an encryption key, unique to you. After generating this you must not change it as it will mean that you are not able to decrypt your passwords from the database.

<hr>
If anything goes wrong I take no responsibility and will not be held accountable, you are using this at your own risk.
